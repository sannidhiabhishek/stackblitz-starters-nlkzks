Current Known Issue:
--------------------
- native eval function doesnot allow to use brackats () [Able to resolve but auto close is not implemented] -> For future implementation
- Orintation [temporary solution: lock orintation of mobile]
- Constant UI updates

Upcomming updates:
------------------
- Force
- Different screen for android and ios

Solition to lock orintation:
--------------------------------------
1:
@media screen and (orientation: landscape) {
      html {
        /* Rotate the content container */
        transform: rotate(-90deg);
        transform-origin: left top;
        /* Set content width to viewport height */
        width: 100vh;
        /* Set content height to viewport width */
        height: 100vw;
        overflow-x: hidden;
        position: absolute;
        top: 100%;
        left: 0;
      }
    }

2:
 @viewport {  
   orientation: portrait;  
 }  
Here is a link we could add which basically does the same thing:

<link rel="stylesheet" media="all and (orientation:portrait)" href="portrait.css">

Above solution may not work on all browsers but hopefully will help. This uses JavaScript to "lock" the orientation & also the 2nd one adds an EventListener to the screen to identify the orientation.

This is how we would lock the orientation:

screen.lockOrientation('portrait');
This is how we would log the orientation:

screen.addEventListener("orientationchange", function () {
  console.log("The orientation of the screen is: " + screen.orientation);
});
